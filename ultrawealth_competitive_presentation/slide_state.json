      "summary": "Continuation covering the final two moats: (4) Network Effects - more investors generate more training data which improves agent performance which attracts more investors, creating a scale advantage barrier with compounding returns; (5) Platform Stickiness - investors experiencing hyper-personalized RL agents will not want template-based alternatives, with switching costs increasing over time as agents learn behavior, creating a behavioral lock-in barrier.
